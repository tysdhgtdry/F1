<p>
Max Verstappen is 26 year born in Belgium, but represents the Netherlands. He is a 3x World Champion and is the most recent champion. He has stayed in the Red Bull academy only being with Toro Rosso and Red Bull Racing. In recent years he has shattered many records with his dominance. He broke the record for most wins in a season by winning 19/22 races. At his age many believe he will break the record for most championships by being the first driver ever to get 8 world championships. Some believe he is only the best because he has the fastest car, but his teammates who drive the same car have never been able to challenge him. If he wins the championship this year, he will be able to secure his status as a legend.
